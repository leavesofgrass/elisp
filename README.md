# My Emacs Configuration
For a detailed guide take a look at [config-breakdown.org](https://github.com/leavesofgrass/elisp/blob/master/config-breakdown.org).

Iâ€™ve broken my Emacs configuration down into different files.

My init file `~/.emacs` sets some basic UI settings and bootstraps the following files:

### package-repo.el
(An elisp file to define package repository details.)

* Package repositories ([GNU ELPA](https://elpa.gnu.org/) and [MELPA](https://melpa.org/))

### load-theme.el
(An elisp file to load all the bits of my theme.)

* Activate `doom-vibrant` from [doom-themes](https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes) (with `doom-modeline-mode`, `doom-themes-neotree`,
`doom-themes-org`, `doom-themes-treemacs`, `doom-themes-visual-bell`)

### custom.el
(An elisp file for the code generated by the Emacs customize interface.)

* [Emacspeak](https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak) default text-to-speech rate
* [minimap.el](https://github.com/dengste/minimap) customizations (right side, smaller, magit integration, and better faces)
* [Dired-sidebar](https://github.com/jojojames/dired-sidebar) with [all-the-icons-dired](https://github.com/jtbm37/all-the-icons-dired) left sidebar file manager
* Selected Packages (List of installed packages)
* Custom faces
* RSS feeds (for [Elfeed](https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed))

### defs.el
(An elisp file for variable definitions.)

* various `setq`

### func.el
(An elisp file for custom function definitions.)

### auto-mode-alist.el
(An elisp file to set automatic modes by file extension.)

### hooks.el
(An elisp file to set how modes interact.)

* [Hooks](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Hooks.html) 

	*Examples:*
  - use line numbers in some modes and not others
  - load [yasnippet](https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet) selectively in some modes
  - use `visual-line-mode` to visually wrap lines in text modes

### keybindings.el
(An elisp file to set custom key sequences and shortcuts in Emacs.)

* Mostly `global-set-key` with old, full-size, keyboards in mind
* Some mode-specific mappings (for [ERC](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/erc.html), `shell`,  and `term`/[multi-term](https://github.com/milkypostman/multi-term) buffers)
* Slowly becoming more sane and ergonomic

### modes.el
(An elisp file to customize modes. This includes, global modes, and the initialization of the [Emacspeak](https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak) text-to-speech subsystem.) 

* Activate global modes [smex](https://github.com/nonsequitur/smex)
* [Undo-Tree](https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/undo-tree.html))
* Loading of [Emacspeak](https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak) `(load-file emacspeak-setup.el)`

### init-packages.el
(An elisp file to make sure the package management tools, mode-line and theme are installed before other things happen.)

* `async`
* `paradox`
* `smex`
* `doom-theme`

### ensure-packages.el
(An elisp file to ensure Emacs packages are installed.)

Installs the remaining Emacs Lisp packages if they are not already installed.
